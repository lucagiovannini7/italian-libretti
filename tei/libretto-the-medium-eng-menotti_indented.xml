A narrow descending stairwell, stage left(leading down to the street). Stage right at the rear,a tall primitive puppet theatre, with a white curtain tohide the standing puppeteer. Next to it a small trunk.On the back wall a large astrological chart whichwill become transparent when light is placed behindit. Downstage right, a door. Upstage left, above thestairwell, a curtained doorway. Downstage left, nearthe center, and old-fashioned three-legged table.Suspended above it a circular lamp of the Victorianperiod, which is lighted by means of a string. In acorner a tiny statue of the Virgin, with a rosaryhanging from it, and a small votive candle in front ofit burning in a red glass jar. Four chairs and a couch.On the wall, near the top of the stairwell, a smallbuzzer which unlocks the door downstairs. The doorbellwhich announces the visitors below must be very loudand strident, so as to be clearly heard above theorchestra. No windows. The time of the day willbe ambiguous throughout the play.</stage>
      <stage>(A s the curtain rises, Toby is seen kneeling near theopen trunk from which he draws out brightly coloredpieces of silk and bead necklaces, bangles, etc. Withsome of these he improvises for himself a fantasticcostume. Monica stands near the couch, which iscovered by a long white dress and a white veil. Sheholds a mirror in one hand, combing her loosenedhair with the other)</stage>
